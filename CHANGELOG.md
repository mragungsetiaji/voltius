## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-09

### Changed

- Linux: read the Termius master key through the system libsecret instead of a
  bundled pure-Rust D-Bus client, roughly halving the Linux binary size with no
  change to import behavior

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- In-app "What's New" changelog modal with consolidated update controls
- X (Twitter) link in the About section
- Per-host shell integration is now inherit-aware
- SSH auto-retries transient connection failures, with configurable keepalive

### Changed

- Redesigned the interface around a unified glass/depth design language —
  grid cards, modals, buttons, toggles, form fields, command palette, and
  object avatars now share consistent elevation, focus rings, and surfaces

### Fixed

- Closing a pane in a multi-pane tab now preserves its siblings
- Closing a multi-pane tab removes its sessions synchronously
- SSH falls back to POSIX sh integration when the remote lacks bash
- Partial connection updates are routed correctly through the form mapper
- Inherited shell-integration toggle is no longer visually dimmed
- Text selection is suppressed while dragging panes

### Fixed

- macOS release build failing to compile: enable the `keychain` feature on `apple-native-keyring-store` (required on macOS)

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- Termius import on Linux now reads the master key from the Secret Service (libsecret), fixing "Termius key not found in OS keychain" (#12)

### Added

- Badge tar-accelerated transfers in the transfer queue
- Fall back to plain transfer when tar is unavailable
- Local-to-local SFTP transfers with progress
- Cancel-all button in the transfer queue
- Browse WSL distros as local SFTP hosts
- Toolbar layout controls replaced with always-visible icon pills
- Single and bulk export for snippets and PF rules

### Fixed

- Solid background for InfoTooltip
- Remote read handles now closed to prevent handle-limit exhaustion
- Symlinks dereferenced for tar downloads to local Windows paths
- Clipboard now uses native Tauri plugin to avoid WebView permission prompt
- Right-panel search results deduplicated when no folders exist
- No longer navigates into a folder when confirming its deletion
- Docked transfer queue styling matches global widget style

### Security

- Bumped russh 0.60 → 0.61.1 (fixes 3 SSH advisories)
- Bumped tar 0.4.45 → 0.4.46 (fixes GHSA-3pv8-6f4r-ffg2)

## [0.1.54] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- macOS `.dmg` installers, plus `.app` updater artifacts so macOS auto-updates work.

## [0.1.52] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- Fedora / RHEL builds: releases now include a native `.rpm` package, installable
  with `sudo dnf install ./Voltius-*.x86_64.rpm`.

### Fixed

  producing roughly 10% smaller binaries.
